# Validation record

Release preparation date: 2026-11-02 (Asia/Seoul).

- Python standard-library unittest: 5 synthetic tests passed.
- Limited public-file/type/secret-pattern scan: passed.
- Manual selected-content review: no actual conversation, researcher corpus, private
  configuration, credential, real experiment or article/book/figure asset selected.
- Examples: synthetic; no scientific or persona-predictive validation claimed.
- Private history import: none; new public repository with a separate initial history.

The scanner is not a complete secret detector, anonymizer or legal clearance tool.
Framework-level code/tests and general methods were selected; private source DBs
and third-party source materials were excluded rather than redacted and republished.
Remote publication is verified separately after committing; this file does not
claim an upload has succeeded merely because local tests passed.

## 2026-11-03 increment

Run `python -m unittest discover -v` and `python audit_publication.py`.
New tests exercise the documented synthetic workflow and rejection boundaries.
On restricted Windows hosts, set TEMP and TMP to an authorized writable directory.
No real corpus, account data, or scientific fidelity evaluation was used.

Second increment: 8 tests passed; failure boundaries and deterministic repeated results covered.

Third increment: 10 tests passed, including supplied-evidence rejection and deterministic output. No external model/search integration tested.

Fourth increment: CLI end-to-end scenarios and failure recovery added. Local tests: 12 passed. Remote CI status is recorded separately in the private development log.

Fifth increment: 14 local tests passed. New CLI paths, source boundaries, deterministic output and tamper/no-overwrite checks are covered. See private development log for remote matrix CI.

Sixth increment: read-only conversation inventory and detail views added. Local
Python standard-library suite: 20 synthetic tests passed, including CLI list/show,
missing database rejection, title override visibility without evidence mutation,
source isolation, pagination, byte-for-byte no-write checks, local/web provenance,
multiple export hashes, and compatibility without optional tables. No real corpus,
online collection, semantic title quality or active-branch reconstruction tested.

Integrated fifth/sixth increment: 22 synthetic tests passed in the cloud workspace.
Both conversation title search and structured read-only list/detail views preserved.
Publication scanning and manifest verification passed for the exact selected files.

Seventh increment: 27 synthetic tests passed. Search regression checks preserve
cross-message AND semantics, title-first ranking, exact match totals, truncation,
and three-snippet caps. An archive with over 8 MB of synthetic message text stays
below 2 MB of traced Python search allocations at limit=2; this excludes SQLite
native memory. SQL trace tests verify page-only title fetches and exact detail
filtering. Empty archives and noninteger search limits are covered.
Latest-title cursor tests cover repeated revisions, source filters, orphan history
entries and a single history query across multiple conversations.

Windows CI exposed a test-fixture connection left open after a transaction. The
fixture now closes it explicitly before temporary-directory cleanup. No production
query logic was changed in this correction. All 27 local tests pass again.

Eighth increment: 36 synthetic tests passed. New web checks cover self/disconnected
cycles, invalid parent/node shapes, duplicate object keys, malformed authors and
timestamps, clean CLI rejection, epoch-zero preservation, unchanged existing archive
bytes on validation failure, a 4,000-node chain, and valid fork order/provenance.
Legacy epoch-zero conflict regression confirms old archive bytes are preserved.

Ninth increment: 38 synthetic tests passed. A regression reproduces the former
null-revision stale-write bypass and now verifies rejection without changing title
history or archive bytes. Missing, boolean, fractional, string and negative leases
are rejected. CLI null-revision and missing-database failures contain no traceback.

Tenth increment: 44 synthetic tests passed. Local excerpt proposals cover English/
Korean greeting skip, explicit greeting fallback, control removal, truncation,
user-only evidence, deterministic/no-write generation, CLI output, and stale-content
rejection. Existing preview/apply handles the proposal; semantic title quality and
external model integration are not tested or claimed.

Eleventh increment: 50 synthetic tests passed. Shared duplicate-key decoding covers
nested/escaped keys, valid Unicode values, local CRLF physical line numbers,
no-create/no-change archive failure boundaries and clean proposal CLI errors.
No real conversation files or private folders were read.
